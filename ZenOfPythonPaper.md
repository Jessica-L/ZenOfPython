Python is highly readable due to its complete set of Style guidelines and Pythonic idioms relayed in detail in the  
Process Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) #8, "Style Guide for Python Code" created by GvR, Warsaw and Coghlan in  
2001.  On August 19, 2004, "The Zen of Python" by Pythoneer Tim Peters was approved as Informational PEP 20. While  
PEP 8 is all about the rules for structuring your code, PEP 20 conveys the inspiration behind how you write your  
Python code. You can access The Zen of Python by visiting https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020 or via the Python  
terminal or command prompt by typing >>import this and pressing Enter.  The below list of Python Zen points will  
print to the screen unnumbered.  
  
	1. Beautiful is better than ugly.  
	2. Explicit is better than implicit.  
	3. Simple is better than complex.  
	4. Complex is better than complicated.  
	5. Flat is better than nested.  
	6. Sparse is better than dense.  
	7. Readability counts.  
	8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
	9. Although practicality beats purity.  
	10. Errors should never pass silently.  
	11. Unless explicitly silenced.  
	12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
	13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
	14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
	15. Now is better than never.  
	16. Although never is often better than *right* now.  
	17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
	18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
	19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!  
  
Python according to its creator Guido van Rossum provides a higher level of readability aimed at the creation of  
reusable code and writes "code can hardly be considered reusable if it's not readable".  In industry, reusable code  
is coveted to help achieve time and memory efficiency.  Why reinvent code that has already been written?  This is  
not a hypothetical question.  Here are the main reasons programmers opt to write their own version of pre-existing  
code:  

	(1) The code is crap in the eyes of the beholder.  
	(2) The code is hard to understand even though it is doing its job.  
	(3) "I'm in too big of a hurry and can code up quickly what I need."  
  
Let's focus on statements (1) and (2) because they often bring about statement (3).  Statements (1) and (2) in the  
case of Python are the result of one or more violations of the Python style guidelines (PEP 8) which are summarized  
in the Zen of Python (PEP 20).  
  
<I'll go into talking about beautiful and simple vs. ugly and complicated using the task of walking a directory tree.>
