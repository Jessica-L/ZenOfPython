The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

We were suprised at how many people do not know about this valuable coding dogma for the Python language, and
therefore have selected this topic for our paper and presentation in hopes of enlightening the realm of Python coders.
There are also poor youTube videos about The Zen of Python and its application, so we were compelled to create one
of substantial value.  While PEP 8 is all about the rules for structuring your code, PEP 20 is all about the
inspiration behind how you write your Python code. 


Body:

How to apply each Zen point?
We will now extrapolate on each point addressed in The Zen of Python by using examples of rejected and approved PEPs as 
well as other examples.
NOTE: We have chosen examples for an audience whose level of coding is moderate to expert.


Conclusion:

Recap of Body
Sure, you need to solve a problem, but if you can solve it beautifully, that's even better.
